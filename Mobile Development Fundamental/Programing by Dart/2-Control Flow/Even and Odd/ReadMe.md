# Even or Odd Categorizer

This project categorizes numbers into even or odd using a for-loop and switch case.

## Features

- Uses a list of numbers.
- Iterates through the numbers using a for-loop.
- Determines whether each number is even or odd using a switch case.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Dart file (`main.dart`) in your preferred Dart environment (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, or DartPad).
3. Run the code to see the output.

## Example Output

3 is odd
5 is odd
2 is even
-7 is odd
0 is even


## Code Explanation

- A list of numbers is defined.
- A for-loop iterates through each number in the list.
- The modulo operator (`%`) determines if a number is even or odd:
  - If the remainder is 0, the number is even.
  - If the remainder is 1, the number is odd.
- A switch case is used for decision-making to categorize the number.

## Repository Structure

- `main.dart`: The main Dart file containing the program code.
- `ReadMe.md`: This file, describing the project.
